## D001 — Does exploitable hard-pair structure exist?

**Structural premise: yes, decisively.** Near-relative model pairs (same
base model, fine-tunes, adjacent versions) are measurably harder to
separate than unrelated pairs (Mann-Whitney p = 3.5e-32 over all 1326 pairs
among 52 models; the paper's own motivating case, Llama-3-70B ↔ Smaug-70B,
lands at the 75th hardness percentile). This premise is not in question.

**Exploitable-tail premise: measured as "no," but the measurement is
suspect, not the underlying claim.** 88.2% of pairs registered as perfectly
separable under this instrument, which flattens each model's response
distribution into a single averaged point before comparing — the opposite
of what the project's own point-cloud-vs-point-cloud rule (invariant I3)
requires. Treat "no hard tail" as **unresolved**, not settled, until a
non-saturating, I3-compliant remeasurement is run. Human approved
commissioning that remeasurement on 2026-09-01 — see [D004](D004.md).

**Practical takeaway for A1 (model universe):** a ≤14B universe satisfies
invariant I1 comfortably (65 near-relative pairs across 37 models), but the
strongest individual near-relative pairs — including the project's own
motivating case — need a 70B-class partner. Recommendation on record:
~25×≤14B core + one 70B pair (Llama-3-70B + Smaug-70B) if D002's measured
budget allows it.
