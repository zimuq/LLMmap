# PLAN.md — D Index

| id | source | status | gate | deps | result pointer |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [D001](D001.md) | TODO T0.1, T0.2 | **CLOSED** 2026-09-02 — R6 answered by D004: TAIL CONFIRMED | REVIEW (P1 approved w/ amendments, executed) | none | `results/D001/`, `D001.md` `## R` |
| [D002](D002.md) | follow-up from D001/P1 §F5 | **CLOSED** 2026-09-02 — GPU_AVAILABLE, own question fully answered | REVIEW (P1 approved, executed) | none | `results/D002/`, `D002.md` `## R` |
| [D003](D003.md) | ADDENDUM.md item 2 | **CLOSED** 2026-09-02 — READY, 233-entry candidate pool (93% of revised ~250 target) | REVIEW (P1 approved w/ amendments, executed) | none directly; its *consumer* (Phase 1 corpus build, D006) depends on A1 (✅ decided 2026-09-05) and C3 (✅ ~250) | `confs/queries/pool_d003_candidates.json`, `results/D003/`, `D003.md` `## R` |
| [D004](D004.md) | D001 §R6, human-approved 2026-09-01 | **CLOSED** 2026-09-02 — TAIL CONFIRMED (CVaR₀.₁/mean=0.616 on the uncensored statistic); `METHOD.md §2`/I1 stand | REVIEW (P1 approved, executed) | none (pure re-analysis of D001's cached embeddings) | `results/D004/`, `D004.md` `## R` |
| [D005](D005.md) | I2 bug found while preparing D004 (TACC note on D001's `## Review`, 2026-09-02) | **CLOSED** 2026-09-04 — FIXED (M1+M2+M3 verified via regression test); shipped-dataset exposure UNDETERMINABLE (M4), no effect on D001/D004's numbers | REVIEW (P1 approved, executed) | none | `results/D005/`, `D005.md` `## R` |
| [D006](D006.md) | TODO.md Phase 1 (T1.1–T1.4) + D002 §R4 + D003 + D005; A1/C4/C7 decided 2026-09-05/06 | **CLOSED** 2026-09-06 — READY at 37/37 (1,197,875 generations); own embedding-normalization bug found and fixed (+0.051 AUC, matches paper's actual procedure) | REVIEW (P1 approved, executed) | none | `results/D006/`, `D006.md` `## R` |
| [D007](D007.md) | TODO.md Phase 1 (T1.5–T1.6); A3 decided 2026-09-06 | **CLOSED** 2026-09-07 — **TAIL CONFIRMED on `S_energy`** (CVaR₀.₁/mean=0.353, uncensored; `S_probe` was 51.8–98.2% ceiling-pinned, A3's gate correctly deferred to `S_energy`). `METHOD.md §2`/I1 stand on the real corpus. Frozen tensor for I6: `S_energy_tok200` | REVIEW (P1 approved, executed) | none | `results/D007/`, `D007.md` `## R` |

## Not yet a D

- **The actual query-strategy comparison (TODO.md T2.1–T2.4: mean-greedy
  vs. CVaR-coverage, the γ sweep, the identifiability frontier)** — **now
  unblocked** (D007 closed, TAIL CONFIRMED). Per TODO.md's own framing
  this phase is "post-processing on the frozen tensor... seconds per
  run" — the expensive part (D006+D007) is done. Next D to draft.

## Notes

- TACC executes only `status: OPEN` D's whose `gate` is satisfied — `AUTO`
  runs immediately, `REVIEW` needs a posted `## Review` with an APPROVED
  verdict.
- "Closed" is a design-side call made after `## R` is posted **and** any
  R-driven open questions are resolved for the D's *own* question. D001–D007
  are all closed as of 2026-09-07 — each answered its own question in full,
  even where (D001/D002) the answer spawned a still-open A-series item that
  outlives the D itself.
